# RomCom

## Instructions
### Overview
This page allows you to create different versions of romantic novel covers. You have the option to create your own, generate random covers, and save your favorites.

### Home view
This view displays a random cover example. From here the user can generate a random cover that can be saved, or navigate to one of the other views.

### View saved covers
The saved covers view allows the user to preview all their saved covers. Double clicking on a cover will remove it from your saved covers list.

### Make your own cover
From this form the user can input their custom image, title, and descriptors to create their own cover. Clicking the "Make my book" button will take the user to the home page with the newly generated cover.
